# fft
Fast Fourier Transform

Open the file fft_learn.ipynb in Google Colab.

I was motivated to study the FFT algorithm when I watched a Reducible's video that showed the implementation is recursive and can be implemented in about 10 lines of Python code. There are many things that we take for granted in today's world that are based on the FFT algorithm. Some of the applications include Wifi, audio/video/image compression, GPS and celular networks just to name a few of them. Here is the Google Colab notebook #Google #GoogleColab #FFT #Pyhton #Fourier #programing
