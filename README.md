Flow, in positive psychology, is a state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, deep involvement, and joy.  
- Cisco Fellow, David McGrew

I recently was involved in an activity that produced me a great deal of joy, since I experienced the flow that David mentioned above. I was motivated to study the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) algorithm when I watched a Reducible's video that showed the implementation for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is recursive and can be implemented in about 10 lines of Python code. There are many things that we take for granted in today's world that are based on the FFT algorithm. Some of the applications include Wifi, audio/video/image compression, GPS, satellite communications and cellular networks just to name a few of them. 

Steps on how I experienced the flow:
1. Watch Reducible FFT video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0
2. Watch Reducible FFT video 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty0JcR6Dvis
3. Check the Google Colab notebook that I created: https://github.com/aavella77/fft/blob/main/fft_learn.ipynb
